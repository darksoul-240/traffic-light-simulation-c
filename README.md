# Traffic Light Simulation (C)

## Summary
C implementation of a traffic light simulator for 3-way and 4-way junctions. Models signal states (RED / YELLOW / GREEN) and uses timers and state transitions to avoid conflicting traffic flows.

## Features
- 3-way and 4-way intersection modes
- State machine-based signal sequencing
- Simple console output for simulation steps

## How to run
1. Compile: `gcc traffic_sim.c -o traffic_sim`
2. Run: `./traffic_sim`
3. Choose 1 for 4-way or 2 for 3-way when prompted.

## Tech
C, basic timers, console I/O

## Notes
This was a team project (Dec 2024). I implemented the core logic and state transitions.
